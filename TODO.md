- Allow running just the flamegraph + .png stuff. Basically just a "run once" setting
- Make sure that standalone can also capture `require`, `autocmd` and other
  events. Not just functions

- Allow profiling Neovim's startup, somehow
 - I think this already works. Just document the process
- Make sure we can read GitHub's YAML false value as a 0 / 1 as expected from environment variables

- Do TODO notes everywhere
